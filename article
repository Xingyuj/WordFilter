Thanks for applying for the Java Developer role at DGIT Systems.
Please send your final code to (tests@dgitsystems.com) with a subject of "Java Developer Coding Assessment [Your Name]" within 24 hours.
Count Words Coding Assignment
Write a program called Count Words that processes a List of Strings and applies the following business rules:
- Counts and returns the NUMBER of words (i.e. Strings) that start with "M" or "m"
- Returns all the words longer than 5 characters

Hints
- Make sure you implement this test like you would all your production code (Documentation, unit tests, build/packaging, etc.).
- Business rules change and new ones pop up all the time; how will you account for this?
- Please don't input words from standard input, no one likes to type long list of names manually.
Let me know if you have any issues or questions regarding the test.
We look forward to reading your response
Thanks very much.
Cheers,
